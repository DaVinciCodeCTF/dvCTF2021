Alert!
A famous online art gallery has just suffered an intrusion!
The hacker has deployed a ransomware and demands an exorbitant ransom to return all of the gallery's data...
Fortunately, their teams had the presence of mind to capture the network at the time of the attack!
You must help them recover their art, at least their most famous, "Flag sur fond de soleil couchant". Its value is inestimable...
Be careful, this pirate seems methodical and experienced! Tracing a precise history of the attack should help you see more clearly!

Flag: `dvCTF{t1m3_i5_n0t_r4nd0m_en0ugh}`
